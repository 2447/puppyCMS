# Styling PuppyCMS is EASY!

Edit `style.txt` in the Puppy Editor and at the top, you will see some code like this:

    @import 'https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Merriweather:900';
		
    $heading_font = Merriweather; /* make sure this matches a Google font above - e.g. 'Open+Sans'  */
    $text_font = 'Open+Sans'; /* make sure this matches a Google font above - e.g. 'Open+Sans'  */

    ...

    $button_color = #007849; /* for the contact form button */
    $button_text_color = #FFFFFF;
    /* end of basic styling */  

By changing the colors of the variables in the stylesheet file, you can change the whole look and feel of PuppyCMS in just a few seconds.

By choosing great Google Fonts and changing the self-explanatory colors, you'll be surprised just how quickly you can make [puppy](http://puppycms.com) look exactly how you want.
