# puppyCMS
pupyCMS is a very simple, flat file CMS that is SEO friendly and responsive - built in PHP (minimum requirements are PHP 5.4). It takes a few seconds to configure (just one config file). It works on all major browsers including mobile versions.

The biggest difference between puppyCMS and other flat file, responsive content management platforms is that its very small, takes seconds to start, uses markdown for easy editing and uses [strapdown.js](http://strapdownjs.com) to produce HTML and templates. [jQuery](http://jquery.com) is used if additional functionality is required.

You can create smart looking micro sites with ease, but if you want to extend them into full sites, then a bit of messing with HTML, maybe some PHP and you can have fully-fledged websites too - very SEO friendly.
